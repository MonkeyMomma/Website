                            <p>Hey y’all, what’s up? Monkey Momma here. I know it’s been forever since I made a post. While I was busy with life in general, I’m not going to make excuses and just tell it how it is. I’ve been having a really rough stretch with my various “invisible illnesses” the past few months.  One of the many things I am having issues with is concentration, which is the primary reason it has taken so long to get another post up. </p>

                            <p>So, y’all remember my last post? The crazy purple grids and snippets that didn’t really say much? Yeah… Anyway, I thought I would attempt to get another post up and figured what better topic than my struggles the past few months with invisible illnesses. I hope to get this post up with better and easier to follow information for y’all, but I am still having lots of issues, so we will see how this turns out. </p>

                            <p>	On the other post, I gave some links to Mayo Clinic descriptions of several common invisible illnesses, but I want to focus more on what I go through personally, and what others I talk to online have said. Of course, not everyone experiences the same thing with these conditions, these are just my experience and examples from the interwebs.</p>

	                           <p>So, for those who haven’t read my other posts, I suffer from many chronic illnesses, including fibromyalgia, depression, PTSD, anxiety, gout, and other conditions. The main thing about all these is, although I suffer pain, mental health issues, negative thought, exhaustion and all sorts of symptoms, there are no outward signs of any of them. Even my husband, with 20 plus years of being together, can’t see anything, although he does usually recognize some of the subtle signs of bad days. But no one else can. Even my doctors have difficulty “seeing” what is going on with me.</p>

<h3><center>But it’s still there, even if no one can see it. </center></h3>

                            <p><center>That’s why they are referred to as “invisible illnesses”.</center></p>

              <p>Perhaps the hardest part of living with an invisible illness is the simple fact that it is invisible. What that means is, there are no clear outward signs that we are disabled. Paralyzed people have wheelchairs, which make it clear to the world they are disabled. People with Down's Syndrome have the facial features that are common with the condition to indicate their condition to the world.  Not that I am complaining that those of us with invisible illnesses aren't in a wheelchair or in some other way clearly disabled. But, since we "look" healthy, or healthy-ish, people often treat us poorly when we are limited by our conditions.</p>

              <p>I have had strangers be rude to me when I am moving slow. I have had strangers say nasty things when I have to sit and rest. Things like if I "just dieted" I wouldn't be "so fat" and have to sit down. No wonder I don't like most people. I eat healthier than most people I know. Because of a medical condition I was diagnosed with at 16, I have had a constant struggle with weight. But my weight was actually never an issue that held me back from anything in life. When I was a paramedic, I was able to run calls, lift patients, help with extrications, even repel down mountain cliffs and hike, carrying a back boarded patient, over a mile in the dark to a safe rendezvous point with my rig. I played baseball for my company team, shot and taught archery, went to the gym daily, if not twice a day. I took my then toddler to the park and almost kept up with her as she was running around. We went for walks in nature, or even around our block. I worked 12-18 hour shifts as an emergency dispatcher, or 24-96 hour shifts as a paramedic without getting tired. Sometimes I thought I was tired, but it wasn’t until I experienced the chronic fatigue of fibromyalgia and severe depression that I utterly understood fatigue. It wasn't until I developed the fibromyalgia that I started having to take rest breaks and not being able to move at a normal speed. </p>

      <h3>Chronic Illness steals your life</h3>
        <p> The symptoms of chronic illnesses can literally steal your life. I have lost my career, my favorite sport, my ability to fully enjoy my favorite place in the world. I miss out on family events because I'm too tired.  I can't always get housework done in a timely manner, because I am usually in too much pain, or I am too exhausted to finish. I can't finish projects in a timely manner.</p>

	      <p>One of the main reasons I don’t do custom orders, instead focusing on individual art pieces is that I can’t guarantee I can make an order by a reasonable deadline. Right now, I am still working on a couple Christmas gifts I am not sure I will be able to finish due to my carpal tunnel syndrome getting worse. I’m suddenly in a wrist splint and my hand is numb. I’m typing this with one hand right now. I started these projects in September, because I know I have to start way ahead if I have a deadline on anything.</p>

	      <p>The last time my family and I went to my favorite place in the entire world, Disneyland, I wasn’t able to fully enjoy the trip. I was in so much pain by an hour into walking around I just could not be fully present in the moment.  The pain and inability to enjoy my Happy Place led to depression symptoms.  It was strange to not feel happy and peaceful on Pirates of the Caribbean, the one place in the world I have always been able to defeat my depression symptoms in the past. Can you imagine how it feels to not be able to be happy at what was once your Happy Place? It is soul crushing. </p>

        <p>My chronic illnesses put me at high risk of serious complications or even death if I contract COVID-19. I barely leave my house, and usually that is only to pick up a grocery order with contactless pick up. My twelve-year-old cannot socialize in person with her friends, so I don’t get sick. I feel so bad that my disabilities are even affecting my child’s life. Even before Covid, my illnesses made us have to leave events early and miss out on things.</p>

        <p>There is so much that chronic illnesses have stolen from me, it is overwhelming. And, when others don't recognize that and treat me rudely or get irritated with me for it, it makes me feel even worse.  That's why I think it is so important for people to know about the symptoms of conditions people they care about. And it is especially important not to be a dick to strangers, because you don't know what they may be going through.</p>

  <h3>Symptoms of Fibromyalgia </h3>
	<p>One of my main chronic illnesses is fibromyalgia.  The medical industry still has much to learn about the causes, treatments and exact way fibromyalgia works in the body.  Most doctors currently think it is an auto-immune disease. The primary symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain. Literally, everything hurts, all the time. The doctors prescribe a variety of pain medications to help control the pain, but none of them truly do.</p>

  <p>There is a heightened pain response to pressure. There are specific spots on the body that are more susceptible to this, but basically anywhere can have issues where it is painful or uncomfortable to be touched. I also have sleep apnea and use a CPAP while sleeping. I often have issues sleeping with the mask on because the mask and straps lay right over my cheekbones, which are a pressure point site for many. Even though I use the smallest mask type my medical provider can prescribe, it still causes problems.  More nights than not, I end up having to take my mask off in the middle of the night because it hurts too much to sleep with it on.  It can also be hard to sleep because of the pressure the bed itself puts on my body. A set of nine paired pressure points along the body are often used to help in diagnosis, as well.</p>

  <p>In addition to the sleeping problems associated with pain and pressure, other sleep issues, like insomnia are a major component of fibromyalgia. The sleep issues contribute to, but are not the only cause of, the major fatigue most fibromyalgia sufferers experience. The fatigue is one of the worse parts of fibromyalgia for me.  Yes, the whole-body pain sucks, but, for me at least, the fatigue causes the most problems.  I wake up exhausted. I spend my day exhausted. I fell asleep writing this blog post a few paragraphs up because I am perpetually exhausted. I usually shower right before bed because the simple act of showering completely drains any energy I have. If I shower in the morning, I must rest after to get even enough energy to sit on the couch.  Washing my hair, which is thick and down to my knees, takes more energy than I have on any given day. I only wash my hair about twice a month, which sounds bad, but it’s the only way I can retain my long braid that I am trying to keep as a symbol of my commitment to my husband. I started growing my hair out from a super short cut I had been wearing for ease in EMS shortly before I met him. When we started dating, he asked me to keep growing my hair as long as we were together.  I promised him I would and have kept that promise for over 20 years.  Something that makes me sad to think about is that I may eventually have to cut my hair as it gets harder and harder for me to care for it myself. </p>

<p>In fact, between the carpal tunnel, fibromyalgia pain and exhaustion, there are times, like now, I can’t even brush out and re-braid my hair already.  I’m sure the few people who see me like this just assume I’m a lazy slob, but I really hate the appearance I present to the world at times like this.  With COVID, it’s a little easier because I don’t have to go out in public. If the neighbors are looking when hubs has me go out to grab the mail to get a few seconds of sunlight, I’m sure they think I’m some shut in slob. I am not really a slob; I try to stay groomed and keep my surroundings clean. It’s just so hard when I am always exhausted.</p>

<p>Memory issues are also a major problem with fibromyalgia, and I am no exception to this. I have a lot of short-term memory issues and often suffer from what is called “brain fog”. Brain Fog really sucks. It can make someone feel like an idiot at times.  I constantly just cannot come up with the names of simple things.  Other people report forgetting other words, but I have noticed nouns are one of the big categories of words I forget. One common thing I forget the name of is the oven. I am constantly having to just describe it or point at it because I simply cannot come up with its name. Other times, there are other words I can’t remember. It can be very embarrassing, especially when it happens around other people. The short-term memory issues are also problematic. I can’t remember things that just happened, or things people have asked me to do. I can’t remember recipes to dishes I’ve been making all my life.  It really makes life difficult and I am sure would make it impossible to hold a job, despite the pain and fatigue. </p>

<p>There are other problems that come with the Fibro as well, such as restless leg syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and numbness or tingling in the extremities.  The numbness and tingling are a fun one to deal with for me (that’s sarcasm, by the way). Whenever an issue like my current hand numbness comes up, it is always a challenge to figure out which condition is the cause. It is critical to figure out whether it’s the carpal tunnel, fibromyalgia, or diabetes since they all have different treatments to fix it.  My doctor thinks the current issue with my hand is a combination of both the fibromyalgia and carpal tunnel. We are going to treat the carpal tunnel, most likely with surgery after the new year (if they let me, maybe I’ll do a blog with pictures of the surgery). But I could still have issues because of the fibromyalgia. It certainly makes life difficult.</p>

<h3><center>But, what IS Fibromyalgia? What causes it?</center></h3>
<p>The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown.  It was only first defined in 1990, with updates to the definition in 2011.  In Europe, it is considered a neurobiological condition, and treated mostly with medications. In America, it is thought to be more of a somatic syndrome.  The ICD-10, which is what most insurance companies look at for payment for treatments, lists Fibro as a disease of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. While much of the medical field, and a great deal of society, dismisses fibromyalgia sufferers as mental cases, the ICD-10 states it is a functional somatic syndrome and NOT a mental disorder. However, the stigma remains and people still judge sufferers. Which makes life even harder for us.</p>

<p>	Fibromyalgia usually onsets during middle age, although it can affect people much younger. It affects women much more often than men. Mental disorders are often co-morbid with fibromyalgia and other chronic illness. For me, these include anxiety, depression, and PTSD.  These conditions cause symptoms that compound the fibromyalgia symptoms. For instance, my anxiety gives me weird dystopian survival dreams. Most the time, every muscle in my body tenses up during these dreams, and I often have sporadic muscle contractions during them. In addition to increasing the chronic fatigue, this increases the muscle pain I am constantly in.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
	<p>The bottom line is chronic illnesses severely affect sufferers’ lives and functionality. We often move slow, have to rest often, and may not look as put together as society deems the “norm”. People often judge us. They say we’re lazy, we should diet, we’re slobs, we’re losers… Well, most chronic illness patients are spending a greater percentage of their energy than a regular person just being out. We watch our diet better than most people because certain things like gluten, sugar, carbs, meats, and about a hundred other things can trigger our illnesses to get worse.  For me, with the many conditions I have, the list of things to avoid eating is extremely long. The list of things I can safely eat is extremely short. We may look like we don’t care about our appearance, but most of the time we do, we just physically can’t do anything about it at the time.  We have typically lost a lot in our lives, so maybe we are losers.
	So, if you see someone who “looks” healthy, or has no obvious signs of disability parking in a handicap spot (with appropriate placards, of course), or using the go-kart buggy in a store, or even just walking or moving slow in the aisle, think twice before you make a mean comment.  Think twice before you make a judgment that the person is lazy for using the go-kart, or cheating the system with the parking placard, or whatever.  That person may have an invisible, chronic illness. Disabilities are not always visible, and it really isn’t your place to judge. Be nice to others. </p>

  <h3><center>This world needs more understanding and less judging.</center></h3>
