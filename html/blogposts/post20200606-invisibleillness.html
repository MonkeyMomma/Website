        <h2>Monkey Momma Creations</h2>

        <p>Hey y'all, what's up? Today we are testing out and playing with some new layout features, and we are going to talk a little about living with what are refered to as "Invisible Illnesses". Again, what I say here is just from my own research and experience, and in no way should be taken as medical advice. I just want to let people know a little about what some of these conditions are like. Since I am testing a new layout, things are going to be a little different in how I write this, by the way.</p>

        <h2>Different types of Invisible Illness</h2>

        <p>To start off, I want to give people a chance to read official information about just a few of these conditions. The links above should take you to Mayo Clinic pages that talk about many of the common "Invisible Illnesses". I think that reading about what these conditions are may help people understand their loved ones and others who suffer these conditions. These are only a very few of the many Invisible Illnesses that exist.</p>

        <p>It's important to point out that not everyone with these conditions will experience them in the same way. But, understanding how others' feel can be a big step in helping them feel better. Many of these illnesses can have a major effect on the patient's mood and self esteem. I know I feel like the fibromyalgia, anxiety, and depression have basically robbed me of many things that were a major part of my life.</p>

            <h2> Living With Invisible Illness </h2>

              <p>Perhaps the hardest part of living with an invisible illness is the simple fact that it is invisible. What that means is, there are no clear outward signs that we are disabled. Paralyzed people have wheelchairs, which make it clear to the world they are disabled. People with Down's Syndrome have the facial features that are common with the condition to indicate their condition to the world.  Not that I am complaining that those of us with invisible illnesses aren't in a wheelchair or in some other way clearly disabled. But, since we "look" healthy, or healthy-ish, people often treat us poorly when we are limited by our conditions.</p>

              <p>I have had strangers be rude to me when I am moving slow. I've had strangers say nasty things when I have to sit and rest. Things like if I "just dieted" I wouldn't be "so fat" and have to sit down. No one I don't like most people. I eat healthier than most people I know. Because of a medical condition, I have had a constant struggle with weight. But, my weight was actually never an issue that held me back from anything in life. It wasn't until I developed the fibromyalgia that I started having to take rest breaks and not being able to move at a normal speed. So, basically, I just wish people would be nicer to others, in general. </p>

          <h2>Fibro steals your life</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of fibromyalgia can literally steal your life. I have lost my career, my favorite sport, my ability to fully enjoy my favorite place in the world... I miss out on family events because I'm too tired.  I can't always get housework done in a timely manner, because I am usually in too much pain, or I am too exhausted to finish. I can't finish projects in a timely manner. Things with deadlines, I have to start way ahead. There is so much that it has stolen from me, it is overwhelming. And, when others don't recognize that and treat me rudely or get irritated with me for it, it makes me feel even worse.  That's why I think it's so important for people to know about the symptoms of conditions people they care about. And, it's especially important not to be a dick to strangers, because you don't know what they may be going through.</p>

          <h2>Other Resources</h2>
           <p> This blog post, like I said above, is mostly to do a page with some styling tests and stuff for a Web Development Course.  That is the reason the appearance is so glaringly different than the rest of my site.  </p>
           <p> The links below are some other resources to read about invisible illness. When I have some more time, I'll either edit this post, or make a better one about these illnesses.  In the meantime, be good to one another. You never know what someone else is dealing with.</p>
